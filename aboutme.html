      <p>
      In regard to technical expertise,
      my wheelhouse revolves around website syntax. 
      HTML and CSS are my most familiar languages, 
      and I have dabbled in JavaScript and Python as well.
      In no way shape or form am I a coding genius, but I am consistent.
      My other life accomplishments attest to that. 
      Prior to my college experience, I decided to dedicate myself for 18 months to a volunteer position
      as a missionary. During this time, I invested thousands of dollars that I saved throughout my high school
      career into serving families and individuals in the Hispanic communities throughout Iowa and Illinois.
      This time taught me many skills that stretched my capacity as a human being. 
      I understood that the deepest wishes of many individuals involved in the communities that I served
      desired to be understood and to make their new landing spot in America their home. 
      Growing up in a military family, I understood how it felt to be lost and out of place, 
      and remembered longing to have someone who could provide the help I so desperately needed.
      This pushed me to learn and gain fluency in the Spanish language,
      which allowed me to connect these individuals to the church in which I served. 
      </p> 
      <img src="./pictures/towers-547113_1280.jpg" alt="purple accented towers">
        Through this experience, my understanding of who I am flourished. 
        My conception of who I wanted to become unveiled itself before my eyes with 4k-type clarity. 
        Pursuing a career in web development will allow me to create sites that can help many people. 
        The capacity of technology reaches more people than I could ever imagine reaching as a missionary,
        and if I can add a little improvement to their lives through my craft, 
        then I can sleep well every night.

        <div class="para">
          <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p>

          <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days</p>

          <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

          <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.</p>
          
          <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.</p>
        
          <p>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
