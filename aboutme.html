        In regard to technical expertise,
        my wheelhouse revolves around website syntax. 
        HTML and CSS are my most familiar languages, 
        and I have dabbled in JavaScript and Python as well.
        In no way shape or form am I a coding genius, but I am consistent.
        My other life accomplishments attest to that. 
        Prior to my college experience, I decided to dedicate myself for 18 months to a volunteer position
        as a missionary. During this time, I invested thousands of dollars that I saved throughout my high school
        career into serving families and individuals in the Hispanic communities throughout Iowa and Illinois.
        This time taught me many skills that stretched my capacity as a human being. 
        I understood that the deepest wishes of many individuals involved in the communities that I served
        desired to be understood and to make their new landing spot in America their home. 
        Growing up in a military family, I understood how it felt to be lost and out of place, 
        and remembered longing to have someone who could provide the help I so desperately needed.
        This pushed me to learn and gain fluency in the Spanish language,
        which allowed me to connect these individuals to the church in which I served.

        <p class="experience">
          Through this experience, my understanding of who I am flourished. 
          My conception of who I wanted to become unveiled itself before my eyes with 4k-type clarity. 
          Pursuing a career in web development will allow me to create sites that can help many people. 
          The capacity of technology reaches more people than I could ever imagine reaching as a missionary,
          and if I can add a little improvement to their lives through my craft, 
          then I can sleep well every night.
