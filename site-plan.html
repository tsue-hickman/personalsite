      <h2>Personal Site Plan</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My goal with this website is to display my capabilities as an up-and-coming
         Web Developer. The purpose for this website is to allow me to put myself 
         out there in a more professional way to link something that I created into 
         my professional accounts, such as LinkedIn, Instagram, or other social media
        sites. This website will allow me to put to use the hard skills that I have
        acquired up to this point to market myself and my capabilities as a potential
        employee for future web development careers. The webpage will cover my
        capabilities to work with JavaScript and Python, HTML and CSS, and other
        soft skills that I have acquired throughout the years in my attempt to develop
        myself as a human being. Some of which are that I speak Spanish fluently;
        and I have worked in Adobe for almost 2 months now, and I have held a job 
        since I was 14 years old.</p>

       <h3>Home || Welcome to My Website || My Ambitions</h3>
       <p>
          
         If you are interested in up-and-coming talent, look no further. 
         Here is where I publish my personal capabilities as a budding professional in the realm of web development.
         Showcasing my capabilities is something that I hope to do through this website, 
         which is pushing me to my personal and professional “unknowns”. 
         My greatest hope and vision is to bring you along with me on this journey 
         I am taking throughout my career,
         excited to give you the opportunity to take your ideas to the next level. 
 
         My goals here are simple. 
         To elevate and to be elevated by others. 
         Any situation can be a win-win with the right attitudes and visions. 
         Establishing a professional identity is a vision I have nurtured since my adolescence,
         and painting that vision into reality is a challenge I aim to tackle with enthusiasm and rigor. 
         This website provides a platform for me to connect my personal and school projects
         to various social media platforms including Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook,
         as well other pertinent social networking services.
         I endeavor to display my capabilities here for potential employers to understand me
         in an uncomplicated manner, allowing for a trouble-free, effortless research experience.

       <h3>A little about me...</h3>
       <p>
         In regard to technical expertise,
         my wheelhouse revolves around website syntax. 
         HTML and CSS are my most familiar languages, 
         and I have dabbled in JavaScript and Python as well.
         In no way shape or form am I a coding genius, but I am consistent.
         My other life accomplishments attest to that. 
         Prior to my college experience, I decided to dedicate myself for 18 months to a volunteer position
         as a missionary. During this time, I invested thousands of dollars that I saved throughout my high school
         career into serving families and individuals in the Hispanic communities throughout Iowa and Illinois.
         This time taught me many skills that stretched my capacity as a human being. 
         I understood that the deepest wishes of many individuals involved in the communities that I served
         desired to be understood and to make their new landing spot in America their home. 
         Growing up in a military family, I understood how it felt to be lost and out of place, 
         and remembered longing to have someone who could provide the help I so desperately needed.
         This pushed me to learn and gain fluency in the Spanish language,
         which allowed me to connect these individuals to the church in which I served. 
         
         Through this experience, my understanding of who I am flourished. 
         My conception of who I wanted to become unveiled itself before my eyes with 4k-type clarity. 
         Pursuing a career in web development will allow me to create sites that can help many people. 
         The capacity of technology reaches more people than I could ever imagine reaching as a missionary,
         and if I can add a little improvement to their lives through my craft, 
         then I can sleep well every night.
